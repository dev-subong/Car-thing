    Subclass of Thread that periodically reads sensor values and calls a user defined callback.

    to not delay the next measurement. Should the reader not be able to fulfil the required sampling rate, it will
    skip readings, so that the time between measurements will always be a multiple of the measurement period.

    To read sensor values synchronously, call the run() method. This will block the calling thread and call the
    measurement callbacks on the same thread. To cancel, raise an exception from your callback.

    To read sensor values asynchronously, call the start() method. This will start a new thread to read the sensors
    and call the callback. To stop the thread, either raise an exception from the callback or call the stop() method.
